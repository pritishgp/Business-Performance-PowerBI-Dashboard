# Business-Performance-PowerBI-Dashboard
Hello Data community, I hope everyone is doing well.

I am presenting to you my new Power BI project I've worked upon recently. This project is associated with Finance Domain and we are generating insights for a product based company dealing in multiple products and in different region. So, let's deep dive into this project and let me provide you with some analysis I have done over the same.

Dataset = Financial Data of Costco

Tools Used - Micrososft Power BI

Operations Performed - Data Gathering, Data Transformation, DAX, Data Visualization, Sharing Insights.

For purpose of making this dashboard, KPI's were enlisted that were Sales, Gross Sales , COGS and Profit for the FY. Secondary Bar graph were added for Country wise sales and Tables added for Top 3 products segment wise sales. Slicers were added Country, Discount Bands, Products, Segments and Quarter.
Bar Chart was added for month wise sales but tweaked with DAX formulation to show sales as per American Fiscal Year i.e. (April-March) instead of January to December. Also, Quarters were added accordingly.

INSIGHTS
1. October was the best month where Sales were at its peak for 2021 and 2022.
2. For 2022 USA recorded highest sales for the business whereas for 2021 Germany recorded the highest sales.
3.  Under Enterprise segment with all the three products i.e. VTT, Velo and Paseo. The business suffered loss in all 3 of them. However, when combined overall business was in a healthy profit.

It was a great experience for me and amazing project to work upon. Huge Thanks to Abhishek Agarrwal - Data Science Tutorial - YT for this dataset and his incredible guidance.

Kindly share your feedbacks and suggestions regarding this project.
